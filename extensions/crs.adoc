== OGC API - Coverage - Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems

This extension allows modification of a request so that it considers Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) provided by the client. Without this extension, all coverage delivery is in the coverage's Native CRS.

To this end, the CRS Extension adds query parameters to the coverage access request, as per Core.

=== Delivery of coverage in a CRS different from Native CRS
A query parameter

    crs={crs}

will transform the result coverage into the CRS indicated by {crs}.

Example:

    http://acme.com/oapi/collections/{collectionid}/coverage?crs=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326

Error conditions:

*   Transformation between Native CRS and Output CRS must be possible.
*   {crs} must be a valid CRS definition. OGC requires that CRSs be identified through URLs given by the http://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/CRSdefinitionResolver/WebHome[resolver syntax].

=== Subsetting Coordinates in a CRS different from Native CRS
A query parameter

    subset-crs={crs}

will interpret the bounding box to be provided in {crs} and transform it into the coverage's Native CRS before applying the subsetting. Note that an axis-parallel bounding box in general may transform into a non-axis-parallel, non-rectangular polygon.

Error conditions:

*   Transformation between Subsetting CRS and Native CRS must be possible.
*   {crs} must be a valid CRS definition. OGC requires that CRSs be identified through URLs given by the http://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/CRSdefinitionResolver/WebHome[resolver syntax].
